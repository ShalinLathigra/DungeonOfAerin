Budget
	What are we working with? Budget directly relates to quality of the resulting game.
Desired Mechanics
	Need to know upfront what is required.
	Are you expecting complex puzzles/bossfights/crafting/etc?
	The further it diverges from the basics, the more expensive it will be:
		2D platformer movement
		5 Small levels
		Basic enemies/hazards
		
Story/Plot
	Are we writing it? Would be more expensive
Art
	We do not have an artist, would require you to find and pay an artist separately
